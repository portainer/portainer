**Portainer CE** is a lightweight ‘universal’ management GUI that can be used to **easily** manage Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes and ACI environments. It is designed to be as **simple** to deploy as it is to use.

Portainer consists of a single container that can run on any cluster. It can be deployed as a Linux container or a Windows native container.

**Portainer** allows you to manage all your orchestrator resources (containers, images, volumes, networks and more) through a super-simple graphical interface.

A fully supported version of Portainer is available for business use. Visit http://www.portainer.io to learn more
